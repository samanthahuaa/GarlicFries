## Description of Website
You have to make an account to access the goodness inside our website. Once logged in, you are presented with two random NBA players that will attempt a relationship with one another. You can "refresh" these players and get a new random player until you are satisfied. Then, one player will buy something to give to the other. The gift recipient will either enjoy or hate the gift. The compatibility of the two players will be judged. If they are deemed a successful couple, they will schedule a date to see a NFL game together.
